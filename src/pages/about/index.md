## The Professional Host Alliance will:

Represent and give a group voice to its membership to provide global industry leadership and vision.

Collaborate both internally and with external partners (i.e. OTAs etc.) to address the key challenges facing professional hosts, and resolve them through building a better technology toolkit.

Share industry insight, trends and best practice with a view to driving the industry forward.

Recognise and reward industry best practice and innovation in short-term rental management.
