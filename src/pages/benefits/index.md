We are a global community of short-term rental operators and property managers with shared beliefs and a common mission:

We are committed to the continuous development of better experiences for guests and hosts.

To support this, we believe there is a need to professionalise the alternative accommodation sector.

We are each committed to developing a sustainable global ecosystem with maximum social and economic impact.

If you share our beliefs and would like to play an active role in shaping the future of our industry, we welcome you to join us.
